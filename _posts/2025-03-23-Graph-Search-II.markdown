## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph with $$11$$ nodes. From every node, you are able to access any other node (not including itself), all with an equal probability of $$\frac{1}{10}$$. What is the expected number of steps to reach all nodes at least once (rounded to the nearest step)?

## Solution

It is clear that we must deal with conditional expectations in the given problem. As a recap, using conditional expectations, we get

$$E[X] = \sum_{Y_i} E[X \mid Y_i] P(Y_i)$$

### Step 1: Formulating Recursive Relation

Lets denote $$E_{i}$$ as the expected number of steps required to  visit $$i$$ un-visited nodes. Note that this does not count our current node.

Now, when the simulation starts, you will take 1 step and enter the first node. After this, 10 nodes remain to be visited. Now, when you take the next path, you will definitely end up on a new node (as all other nodes are unvisited). Lets say this step is done. Now, you are on your 2nd node, with 9 unvisited, and 1 visited. Now, with probability $$\frac{1}{10}$$, you may end up on an already visited note, and with probability $$\frac{9}{10}$$, you may end up on a new un-visited node.

Therefore, for our second iteration, we could write
$$E_{9} = (\frac{1}{10} \times (1 + E_{9})) + (\frac{9}{10} \times (1 + E_{8}))$$

Note that the + 1 is added in each term as you take one step to reach there.

### Step 2: Generalizing the Relation

After a few iterations, it will be clear that the relation can be generalized as follows - 
> "If you must visit n nodes more, then with probability $$\frac{10 - n}{10}$$ you will reach an already visited node (where you will take $$E_{n}$$ steps), and with probability $$\frac{n}{10}$$ you will visit a new node (where you will take $$E_{n-1}$$ steps)."

Therefore, 

$$E_{n} = (\frac{10 - n}{10} \times (1 + E_{n})) + (\frac{n}{10} \times (1 + E_{n-1}))$$

On simplification, we get

$$E_{n} = \frac{10}{n} + E_{n-1}$$

### Step 3: Solving Recursion

Now that we have established the recurrence relation 

$$E_{n} = \frac{10}{n} + E_{n-1},$$

we can solve it iteratively to find a general expression for $$E_{10}$$, which is the expected number of steps to visit all 10 new nodes at least once. Note that we will also need to add 1 to this, as that will mark our "first" step into the graph (because its only on our first node we need to walk $$E_{10}$$ steps more. We must include that first step to our first node as well).

First, note that the recurrence starts with $$E_{0} = 0$$ since when no nodes are unvisited, no more steps are required.

Now, letâ€™s compute the values step by step:

- For $$E_1$$:
  $$
  E_1 = \frac{10}{1} + E_0 = 10 + 0 = 10.
  $$

- For $$E_2$$:
  $$
  E_2 = \frac{10}{2} + E_1 = 5 + 10 = 15.
  $$

- For $$E_3$$:
  $$
  E_3 = \frac{10}{3} + E_2 = \frac{10}{3} + 15 \approx 3.33 + 15 = 18.33.
  $$

- For $$E_4$$:
  $$
  E_4 = \frac{10}{4} + E_3 = 2.5 + 18.33 \approx 20.83.
  $$

- For $$E_5$$:
  $$
  E_5 = \frac{10}{5} + E_4 = 2 + 20.83 \approx 22.83.
  $$

- For $$E_6$$:
  $$
  E_6 = \frac{10}{6} + E_5 = \frac{5}{3} + 22.83 \approx 1.67 + 22.83 = 24.5.
  $$

- For $$E_7$$:
  $$
  E_7 = \frac{10}{7} + E_6 = \frac{10}{7} + 24.5 \approx 1.43 + 24.5 = 25.93.
  $$

- For $$E_8$$:
  $$
  E_8 = \frac{10}{8} + E_7 = \frac{5}{4} + 25.93 \approx 1.25 + 25.93 = 27.18.
  $$

- For $$E_9$$:
  $$
  E_9 = \frac{10}{9} + E_8 = \frac{10}{9} + 27.18 \approx 1.11 + 27.18 = 28.29.
  $$

- Finally, for $$E_{10}$$:
  $$
  E_{10} = \frac{10}{10} + E_9 = 1 + 28.29 \approx 29.29.
  $$

As discussed earlier, we must add 1 to account for our first step on the 11th node (from where we start exploring the remaining 10 nodes). Therefore, 

$$
  Ans = 1 + E_10 = 1 + 29.29 \approx 30.29.
$$


### Thus, the expected number of steps to visit all 11 nodes at least once is approximately **30.29**, which rounds to **30** steps.
