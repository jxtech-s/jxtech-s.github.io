<p>A chess tournament has 128 players, each with a <strong>distinct</strong> rating. Assume that the player with the <strong>higher rating always wins</strong> against a lower rated opponent and that the winner proceeds to the subsequent round. What is the probability that the highest rated and second-highest rated players will <strong>meet in the final</strong>?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution"><strong>Solution</strong></h3>

<p>Before proceeding to the question, let‚Äôs think of the following situation -<br />
Initially, 128 people are divided into 2 groups of 64 people each.<br />
In every round, each group will play within itself (say each guy plays with the guy beside him). How will a group play within itself?</p>

<p>Consider group A with \(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, \dots, A_{63}, A_{64}\).<br />
Let‚Äôs say that adjacent people play chess with each other. Then the games will be:</p>

\[(A_1 - A_2), (A_3 - A_4), \dots, (A_{63} - A_{64})\]

<p>From each game, <strong>one person (with the higher skill) will win</strong>.<br />
Thus, after the first round, we will have <strong>32 players remaining</strong>.</p>

<p>This process will go on until only <strong>one guy remains in each group</strong>, and that person will play with the person from another group to decide the <strong>final winner</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, try to convince yourself that this model is <strong>exactly the same</strong> as the situation given in the question.<br />
How?</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the <strong>initial distribution</strong> of people among <strong>Group A and B</strong>, and the <strong>arrangement of people within both groups</strong> are all <strong>random</strong>, it will consider all possible plays between every player.</li>
  <li>Each <strong>unique initial arrangement corresponds to a unique gameplay</strong>.</li>
  <li>Since by <strong>randomizing the initial group allotment</strong>, all possible distributions of people in Group A and B are considered, it means <strong>all possible gameplays</strong> are also considered.</li>
  <li>Which <strong>exactly models the question‚Äôs situation</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="key-observation">Key Observation</h3>

<p>In our model of the gameplay, the <strong>highest-rated and second-highest-rated player</strong> will <strong>face off against each other</strong> <strong>only when they are in different groups initially</strong>.</p>

<p>This problem is now much simpler, effectively reducing it to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>‚ÄúIn how many ways can I arrange 128 people in 2 groups (their position within the group is unique), such that 2 particular people are always in different groups?‚Äù</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="solving-the-sub-problem">Solving the Sub-Problem</h3>

<p>First, let‚Äôs <strong>allot the highest player and second-highest player</strong> to each group.<br />
There are <strong>2 ways</strong> of doing this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Highest -&gt; Group A, Second-Highest -&gt; Group B</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Highest -&gt; Group B, Second-Highest -&gt; Group A</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, once this is done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Out of the remaining <strong>126 people</strong>, select <strong>63</strong> people for Group A.</li>
  <li>The remaining <strong>63</strong> go to Group B.</li>
  <li>Now, we must <strong>arrange the people within each group itself</strong>, thus another  \((64!) \times (64!)\) (one for each group).</li>
</ul>

<p>Our final expression for the <strong>favorable cases</strong> becomes:</p>

\[n(A) = 2 \times \binom{126}{63} \times (64!) \times (64!)\]

<p>where  \(A\) is the event described above.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="computing-the-probability">Computing the Probability</h3>

<p>To find the probability of this arrangement, we must compute the <strong>total number of possible arrangements</strong>.<br />
Clearly, this is  \(128!\) because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can linearly arrange all 128 people in \(128!\) ways.</li>
  <li>Assuming a <strong>partition after  \(P_{64}\)</strong> (representing the end of Group A and the beginning of Group B), all possible distributions are covered.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus,</p>

\[n(S) = 128!\]

<p>The required probability is:</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}\]

<p>Substituting values:</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times \binom{126}{63} \times (64!)^2}{128!}\]

<p>Expanding the combination formula:</p>

\[\binom{126}{63} = \frac{126!}{63! \times 63!}\]

<p>Thus:</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times 126! \times (64!)^2}{63! \times 63! \times 128!}\]

<p>Expanding \(128!\) as \(128 \times 127 \times 126!\):</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times 126! \times 64! \times 64!}{63! \times 63! \times 128 \times 127 \times 126!}\]

<p>Canceling \(126!\):</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times 64! \times 64!}{63! \times 63! \times 128 \times 127}\]

<p>Using:</p>

\[\frac{64!}{63!} = 64\]

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times 64 \times 64}{128 \times 127}\]

<p>Simplifying:</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{64}{127}\]

<hr />

<h3 id="final-answer">Final Answer</h3>

\[\boxed{\frac{64}{127}}\]

<p>Thus, the probability that the <strong>highest-rated and second-highest-rated players meet in the final</strong> is  \(\frac{64}{127}\).</p>]]></content><author><name>JXTech</name></author><category term="Probability" /><category term="Statistics" /><category term="Problems" /><category term="Probability" /><category term="Uniform Distribution" /><category term="Triangle" /><category term="Integration" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem Statement]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Random Angle II</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/probability/statistics/problems/2025/02/23/Random-Angle-II.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Random Angle II" /><published>2025-02-23T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2025-02-23T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/probability/statistics/problems/2025/02/23/Random-Angle-II</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/probability/statistics/problems/2025/02/23/Random-Angle-II.html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="problem-statement"><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h3>
<p>A right triangle is being formed with legs labeled <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>. The random lengths of legs<br />
<strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are both IID <strong>Uniform(0,1)</strong> random variables.</p>

<p>Let <strong>Œ∏</strong> be the angle (in radians) opposite to side <strong>A</strong>. Find the probability that:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3)\]

<p><strong>Original Problem Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.quantguide.io/questions/random-angle-ii">Click here</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution"><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
<p>Now we must find \(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3)\).</p>

<p>Note that,</p>

\[\tan(\theta) = \frac{A}{B}\]

<p>where <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> both are IID <strong>Uniform(0,1)</strong> random variables.</p>

<p>For convenience, let‚Äôs fix <strong>B</strong> for now. Then, this problem becomes much simpler. It reduces to:</p>

<p><strong>Given</strong> \(\tan(\theta) = A/B\), where <strong>A</strong> is <strong>Uniform(0,1)</strong>, <strong>B</strong> is a given constant,<br />
find \(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3)\).</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs try and solve this sub-problem:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = P(\tan(\theta) &gt; \sqrt{3}) = P(A/B &gt; \sqrt{3}) = P(A &gt; B\sqrt{3})\]

<p>Now, since <strong>A</strong> is a <strong>Uniform(0,1)</strong> random variable, clearly:</p>

\[P(A &gt; x) = \max(0, 1-x)\]

<p><strong>(How? ü§î)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If \(x\) is between <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong>, well and good.</li>
  <li>If \(x &gt; 1\), since <strong>A</strong> cannot be greater than 1, \(P(A &gt; x) = 0\).</li>
  <li>Still confused? Try intuitively finding \(P(A&gt;0)\), \(P(A&gt;1/2)\), and \(P(A&gt;1)\). You will see the essence of the above expression.</li>
  <li>Still confused? Read up on <strong>PDF (Probability Density Function)</strong> and <strong>CDF (Cumulative Density Function)</strong><br />
of the <strong>continuous Uniform distribution</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, for the smaller sub-problem above:</p>

\[P(A &gt; B\sqrt{3}) = 1 - B\sqrt{3}\]

<p>for all <strong>\(1 - B\sqrt{3} \geq 0 \Rightarrow B \leq 1/\sqrt{3}\)</strong>.</p>

<p>Essentially, this is equivalent to writing:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3 \mid B) = 1 - B\sqrt{3}\]

<p><strong>Why? ü§î</strong><br />
Because <strong>\(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3 \mid B)\)</strong> represents the probability of \(\theta\) being greater than \(\pi/3\),<br />
<strong>given some B / conditioned on some B</strong>.</p>

<p>This is exactly what we calculated above! By fixing <strong>B</strong>, we found <strong>\(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3)\)</strong><br />
in terms of some <strong>B</strong>, for a given <strong>B</strong>.</p>

<p>But of course, as the question states, <strong>B</strong> is also a <strong>Uniform(0,1)</strong> random variable.</p>

<p>We shall now use the <strong>fundamental law of total probability</strong> here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="step-2-using-the-law-of-total-probability"><strong>Step 2: Using the Law of Total Probability</strong></h3>
<p>Note that we can say:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \sum P(\theta &gt; \pi/3 \mid B) P(B)\]

<p>for all <strong>B</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, we must compute <strong>\(P(B)\)</strong>.</p>

<p>What exactly does this represent? ü§î</p>

<p>It basically asks:<br />
<em>‚ÄúWhat is the probability of choosing a particular \(B\) from \([0,1]\)?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Very small, right?</p>

<p>How do we quantify this? <strong>Using calculus!</strong></p>

<p>We can say that the probability of choosing a particular \(B\) from \([0,1]\) is essentially:</p>

\[\frac{dB}{1} = dB\]

<p>where <strong>dB</strong> is a very small term.</p>

<p>Notice that now our summation actually <strong>reduces to a simple integration</strong>, due to our usage of<br />
<strong>‚Äúelemental B‚Äù or ‚ÄúdB‚Äù</strong> to model \(P(B)\).</p>

<p>Ideally, we should vary <strong>B</strong> from <strong>0 to 1</strong>, but note that <strong>B must be ‚â§ 1/‚àö3</strong>,<br />
otherwise <strong>\(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3 \mid B) = 0\)</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we rewrite the above expression as a definite integral:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \int_{0}^{1/\sqrt{3}} (1 - B\sqrt{3}) dB\]

<hr />

<h3 id="step-3-solving-the-integral"><strong>Step 3: Solving the Integral</strong></h3>
<p>Expanding the integral:</p>

\[\int_{0}^{1/\sqrt{3}} (1 - B\sqrt{3}) dB\]

<p>We solve separately:</p>

\[\int 1 \, dB = B\]

\[\int B\sqrt{3} \, dB = \frac{\sqrt{3} B^2}{2}\]

<p>Evaluating from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1/‚àö3</strong>:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \left[ B - \frac{\sqrt{3} B^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{1/\sqrt{3}}\]

<p>Substituting <strong>B = 1/‚àö3</strong>:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \frac{\sqrt{3} (1/3)}{2}\]

\[= \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\]

\[= \frac{2}{2\sqrt{3}} - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\]

\[= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\]

<p>Thus,</p>

\[\boxed{P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}}\]

<hr />

<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Using a combination of <strong>probability concepts, the law of total probability, and calculus</strong>,<br />
we found that the probability of <strong>Œ∏ exceeding œÄ/3</strong> is <strong>1/2‚àö3</strong>.</p>

<p>This problem highlights how fundamental probability techniques can be used to analyze <strong>geometric randomness</strong>.</p>
