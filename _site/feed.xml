<p>A chess tournament has 128 players, each with a  distinct  rating. Assume that the player with the  higher rating always wins  against a lower rated opponent and that the winner proceeds to the subsequent round. What is the probability that the highest rated and second-highest rated players will  meet in the final ?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to the question, let‚Äôs think of the following situation -<br />
Initially, 128 people are divided into 2 groups of 64 people each.<br />
In every round, each group will play within itself (say each guy plays with the guy beside him). How will a group play within itself?</p>

<p>Consider group A with \(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, \dots, A_{63}, A_{64}\).<br />
Let‚Äôs say that adjacent people play chess with each other. Then the games will be:</p>

\[(A_1 - A_2), (A_3 - A_4), \dots, (A_{63} - A_{64})\]

<p>From each game,  one person (with the higher skill) will win .<br />
Thus, after the first round, we will have  32 players remaining .</p>

<p>This process will go on until only  one guy remains in each group , and that person will play with the person from another group to decide the  final winner .</p>

<p>Now, try to convince yourself that this model is  exactly the same  as the situation given in the question.<br />
How? ü§î</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the  initial distribution  of people among  Group A and B , and the  arrangement of people within both groups  are all  random , it will consider all possible plays between every player.</li>
  <li>Each  unique initial arrangement corresponds to a unique gameplay .</li>
  <li>Since by  randomizing the initial group allotment , all possible distributions of people in Group A and B are considered, it means  all possible gameplays  are also considered. This exactly models the given problem.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="key-observation">Key Observation</h3>

<p>In our model of the gameplay, the  highest-rated and second-highest-rated player  will  face off against each other   only when they are in different groups initially .</p>

<p>This problem is now much simpler, effectively reducing it to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In how many ways can I arrange 128 people in 2 groups (their position within the group is unique), such that 2 particular people are always in different groups?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="solving-the-sub-problem">Solving the Sub-Problem</h3>

<p>First, let‚Äôs allot the highest player and second-highest player to each group.<br />
There are  2 ways  of doing this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Highest -&gt; Group A, Second-Highest -&gt; Group B</li>
  <li>Highest -&gt; Group B, Second-Highest -&gt; Group A</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, once this is done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Out of the remaining  126 people , select  63  people for Group A.</li>
  <li>The remaining  63  go to Group B.</li>
  <li>Now, we must  arrange the people within each group itself , thus another  \((64!) \times (64!)\) (one for each group).</li>
</ul>

<p>Our final expression for the  favorable cases  becomes:</p>

\[n(A) = 2 \times \binom{126}{63} \times (64!) \times (64!)\]

<p>where  \(A\) is the event described above.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="computing-the-probability">Computing the Probability</h3>

<p>To find the probability of this arrangement, we must compute the  total number of possible arrangements .<br />
Clearly, this is  \(128!\) How ü§î ?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assume a partition after \(P_{64}\)  (representing the end of Group A and the beginning of Group B) exists, to seperate groups A and B.</li>
  <li>We can linearly arrange all 128 people in \(128!\) ways. Thus each combination will represent a unique gameplay.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus,</p>

\[n(S) = 128!\]

<p>The required probability is:</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}\]

<p>Substituting values:</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times \binom{126}{63} \times (64!)^2}{128!}\]

<p>Expanding the combination formula:</p>

\[\binom{126}{63} = \frac{126!}{63! \times 63!}\]

<p>Thus:</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times 126! \times (64!)^2}{63! \times 63! \times 128!}\]

<p>Expanding \(128!\) as \(128 \times 127 \times 126!\):</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times 126! \times 64! \times 64!}{63! \times 63! \times 128 \times 127 \times 126!}\]

<p>Canceling \(126!\):</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times 64! \times 64!}{63! \times 63! \times 128 \times 127}\]

<p>Using:</p>

\[\frac{64!}{63!} = 64\]

\[P(A) = \frac{2 \times 64 \times 64}{128 \times 127}\]

<p>Simplifying:</p>

\[P(A) = \frac{64}{127}\]

<hr />

<h3 id="final-answer">Final Answer</h3>

\[\boxed{\frac{64}{127}}\]

<h2 id="thus-the-probability-that-the--highest-rated-and-second-highest-rated-players-meet-in-the-final--is--frac64127">Thus, the probability that the  highest-rated and second-highest-rated players meet in the final  is  \(\frac{64}{127}\).</h2>

<p>A right triangle is being formed with legs labeled  A  and  B . The random lengths of legs<br />
 A  and  B  are both IID  Uniform(0,1)  random variables.</p>

<p>Let  Œ∏  be the angle (in radians) opposite to side  A . Find the probability that:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3)\]

<p>Original Problem Link:  <a href="https://www.quantguide.io/questions/random-angle-ii">Click here</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Now we must find \(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3)\).</p>

<p>Note that,</p>

\[\tan(\theta) = \frac{A}{B}\]

<p>where  A  and  B  both are IID  Uniform(0,1)  random variables.</p>

<p>For convenience, let‚Äôs fix  B  for now. Then, this problem becomes much simpler. It reduces to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given  \(\tan(\theta) = A/B\), where  A  is  Uniform(0,1) ,  B  is a given constant,<br />
find \(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3)\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let‚Äôs try and solve this sub-problem:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = P(\tan(\theta) &gt; \sqrt{3}) = P(A/B &gt; \sqrt{3}) = P(A &gt; B\sqrt{3})\]

<p>Now, since  A  is a  Uniform(0,1)  random variable, clearly:</p>

\[P(A &gt; x) = \max(0, 1-x)\]

<p>(How? ü§î)</p>
<ul>
  <li>If \(x\) is between  0  and  1 , well and good.</li>
  <li>If \(x &gt; 1\), since  A  cannot be greater than 1, \(P(A &gt; x) = 0\).</li>
  <li>Still confused? Try intuitively finding \(P(A&gt;0)\), \(P(A&gt;1/2)\), and \(P(A&gt;1)\). You will see the essence of the above expression.</li>
  <li>Still confused? Read up on  PDF (Probability Density Function)  and  CDF (Cumulative Density Function) <br />
of the  continuous Uniform distribution .</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, for the smaller sub-problem above:</p>

\[P(A &gt; B\sqrt{3}) = 1 - B\sqrt{3}\]

<p>for all  \(1 - B\sqrt{3} \geq 0 \Rightarrow B \leq 1/\sqrt{3}\) .</p>

<p>Essentially, this is equivalent to writing:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3 \mid B) = 1 - B\sqrt{3}\]

<p>Why? ü§î <br />
Because  \(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3 \mid B)\)  represents the probability of \(\theta\) being greater than \(\pi/3\),<br />
 given some B / conditioned on some B .</p>

<p>This is exactly what we calculated above! By fixing  B , we found  \(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3)\) <br />
in terms of some  B , for a given  B .</p>

<p>But of course, as the question states,  B  is also a  Uniform(0,1)  random variable.</p>

<p>We shall now use the  fundamental law of total probability  here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="step-2-using-the-law-of-total-probability">Step 2: Using the Law of Total Probability</h3>
<p>Note that we can say:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \sum P(\theta &gt; \pi/3 \mid B) P(B)\]

<p>for all  B .</p>

<p>Now, we must compute  \(P(B)\) .</p>

<p>What exactly does this represent? ü§î</p>

<p>It basically asks:<br />
<em>‚ÄúWhat is the probability of choosing a particular \(B\) from \([0,1]\)?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Very small, right?</p>

<p>How do we quantify this?  Using calculus!</p>

<p>We can say that the probability of choosing a particular \(B\) from \([0,1]\) is essentially:</p>

\[\frac{dB}{1} = dB\]

<p>where  dB  is a very small term.</p>

<p>Notice that now our summation actually  reduces to a simple integration , due to our usage of<br />
 ‚Äúelemental B‚Äù or ‚ÄúdB‚Äù  to model \(P(B)\).</p>

<p>Ideally, we should vary  B  from  0 to 1 , but note that  B must be ‚â§ 1/‚àö3 ,<br />
otherwise  \(P(\theta &gt; \pi/3 \mid B) = 0\) .</p>

<p>Therefore, we rewrite the above expression as a definite integral:</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \int_{0}^{1/\sqrt{3}} (1 - B\sqrt{3}) dB\]

<hr />

<h3 id="step-3-solving-the-integral">Step 3: Solving the Integral</h3>
<p>Expanding the integral:</p>

\[\int_{0}^{1/\sqrt{3}} (1 - B\sqrt{3}) dB\]

<p>We solve separately:</p>

\[\int 1 \, dB = B\]

\[\int B\sqrt{3} \, dB = \frac{\sqrt{3} B^2}{2}\]

<p>Evaluating from  0  to  1/‚àö3 :</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \left[ B - \frac{\sqrt{3} B^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{1/\sqrt{3}}\]

<p>Substituting  B = 1/‚àö3 :</p>

\[P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \frac{\sqrt{3} (1/3)}{2}\]

\[= \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\]

\[= \frac{2}{2\sqrt{3}} - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\]

\[= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\]

<p>Thus,</p>

\[\boxed{P(\theta &gt; \pi/3) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}}\]

<hr />

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using a combination of  probability concepts, the law of total probability, and calculus ,<br />
we found that the probability of  Œ∏ exceeding œÄ/3  is  1/2‚àö3 .</p>

<p>This problem highlights how fundamental probability techniques can be used to analyze  geometric randomness .</p>
