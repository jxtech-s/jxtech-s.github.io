JXTech is where **computing meets probability, statistics, and intelligence**. We are on a mission to push the boundaries of **efficient computing** and **intelligent agents**, driven by a deep mathematical foundation. Like all great endeavors, this mission is a work in progress—evolving, improving, and striving for lasting impact.  

Our focus lies in **high-performance computing, machine learning, and reinforcement learning**, with a special emphasis on the **probabilistic and statistical principles** that underpin these fields. To honor this foundation, we maintain a dedicated **Probability and Statistics** section, featuring engaging puzzles, thought-provoking discussions, and real-world applications of mathematical insights.  

This is just the beginning. JXTech aims to grow into a platform that fosters research, innovation, and open discussions in **intelligent computing**. Stay tuned as we embark on this journey to shape the future of technology.
